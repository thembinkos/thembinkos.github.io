<h3>Brief History About Bhulu</h3>
<p>It is not yet clear where Bhulu migrated from and where he died. Did he fight any wars? Did he negotiate
his way through the journey of migration? Did he move with the missionaries? What language did he
speak? What tribe or clan did he belong to? It is all unknown, but a few stories have been said. The truth
  is yet to be established.
Some believe that he used to live at Empandeni as Ndebele tribe (area where there is a Catholic Church
Mission school and church now).<br><br> But believed to have migrated far South to Tshitshi area and later to
current Bhulu Primary school, after refusing to remain married to one wife only. Bhulu had multiple wives
as their tradition. [Ref: Agnes Ntuntu Tshuma].
Some believe that Bhulu, from Nanzwa tribe, north of now Hwange, migrated down south and
temporarily lived at the area now called Empandeni. He further moved South to the now Tshitshi area
  where he died.<br><br>
His grandson Ndawana, who used to call himself Bhulu Tshuma, migrated further South
and settled at the place where the Bhulu Primary School is located now, after an agreement with
Mpoengs. The Bhulu Primary school used to give Sporting Houses the names of Ndawana’s sons Mvelo
and Mboloma in honour of them. [Ref1: HM “Big Rock” Ndlovu], [Ref2: Bigboy Alphonse Tshuma].
The myth of Bhulu history still remains a mammoth of research work to be done.</p>
